# Deployment
## Heroku deployment with Docker container
# Define Database Functionality + Input Data
1.  Store user information.
2.  Store problems.
3.  Store user's solutions attempts.
# Define Models
**User**
-   username => string (40) / not null / unique
-   email => string (255) / not null / unique
-   hashed_password => binary string
-   userGeocode => string (128) / not null

**Problems**
-   title => string / not null
-   instructions => string / not null  
-   default-content => string / not null
-   solution => string / not null
-   difficulty => integer / not null
-   categories => string

**Attempts**
-   user_id => integer / not null
-   problem_id => integer / not null
-   saved code => string
-   solved => boolean

# Define Database Relations
## Attempts and Users
	 
# Seeding the Database
-   Manual compilation of problems data

# APIs CRUD Operations
- /user/
- /user/login
- /message/list
- /message/send
# UI Layout
-
# Tools
-   VS Code
-   Docker
-   Firefox, Chrome
-   GitHub
-   Coffee


# Idea 1: code challenge
## "basic coding challenges/(racing?)"
- (library for react code components: https://github.com/securingsincity/react-ace)
- User account and info
- Interactive code repl
  - (clock?)
  - button for running code
    - shows simple console output
  - button for running tests (submit?)
    - shows test output
    - should this automatically save the code?
  - reset button?
  - save progress button
- Coding Problems
- Tests for the problems
- Solutions for problems
- Your own solution for a given problem
- Dashboard with problems youâ€™ve attempted
- time to solve/score
- bonus: profile page with stats/progress
- bonus: discussion/comments on coding problems
- bonus: timed challenge mode
